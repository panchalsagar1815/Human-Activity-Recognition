#**Project Title: Human Activity Recognition with Neural Networks**

**Project Description:**

The Human Activity Recognition project aims to develop an intelligent system capable of accurately classifying and recognizing various human activities based on sensor data. The dataset used in this project includes a comprehensive set of features extracted from accelerometer and gyroscope sensors, providing detailed information about body and gravity accelerations in different directions.

**Key Features of the Dataset:**
- Accelerometer features: mean, standard deviation, median absolute deviation, maximum, minimum, signal magnitude area, energy, interquartile range, entropy, autoregressive coefficients, and correlation between axes.
- Gravity accelerometer features: similar set as accelerometer features.

**Project Workflow:**

1. **Data Cleaning Techniques:**
   - Handling missing values.
   - Removing duplicate entries.
   - Checking for outliers and anomalies.

2. **Data Visualization:**
   - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution and patterns in the data.
   - Visualizing time series data to gain insights into activity patterns.

3. **Statistical Analysis:**
   - Descriptive statistics to summarize the main characteristics of the dataset.
   - Inferential statistics to make predictions and inferences about the population.

4. **Data Scaling:**
   - Normalizing or standardizing the data to ensure that all features contribute equally to the model.

5. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):**
   - Dimensionality reduction using PCA to capture the most relevant information from the dataset while reducing computational complexity.

6. **Neural Network Model:**
   - Designing a neural network architecture for human activity recognition.
   - Training the model using the preprocessed and scaled data.
